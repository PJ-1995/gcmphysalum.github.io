# GCM Physics Alumni Resource Hub

*Standing at a juncture finishing your graduation/post-graduation and thinking about opting a career in scientific research demands a thoughtful and an informed decision on the WHY, WHAT and HOW of preparing yourself for a successful career. Why should you be pursuing research is a question that needs to be answered by yourself based on your interest and a number of parameters which only you could weigh. Here, we are trying to help with the other two questions by accumulating a number of resources that we believe to be helpful to you as well as guiding you towards a few active research areas and groups which you can check out.*

### Online Resources
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The following are some physics online courses that could be found useful at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The video lectures would constitute only a small portion of a course. One should download tutorials, lecture notes, problem sets, and exam papers. Unfortunately, many universities in India do not cultivate this culture of seeking knowledge elsewhere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These video lectures are so awesome that you can merely sit and listen to these lectures and grasp a great deal of things, but it will only be fruitful by doing related problems and exam papers as seriously as one would do in a course. Below, we have tried to organize them according to difficulty levels.

### Text Books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Deep and clear understanding about a subject cannot be gulped down from that-one-book-mentioned-in-the-university-syllabus alone. As a matter of fact, text book revisions are a Herculean tasks at most of the universities and may take decades. It is important to read good text books with updated information. Also, we need to deconstruct the idea of monogamy towards text books. For a better understanding, you would want to read different books on that topic. This methodology gives you greater insight towards the subject as well as helps you to approach the text books more objectively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have listed a few text books - based on the undergraduate & postgraduate syllabus, as well as supplimentary text books which will help the more curious ones among you to read beyond and aboves the syllabus.

- [**List of Standard Text Books - based on MSc Syllabus**]()
- [**List of Supplementary Text Books - by Research Area**]()

### Active Research Areas and Research Groups
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In order to develop your taste and to recognize your true interests, it is important to become familiar with the current and active research areas. Furthermore, you should be familiar with the groups/institutes where these activities are taking place. Interested students can also use the information given in this section to directly approach these faculties/groups for summer projects or laboratory visits.

### About the GCM Physics Alumni Resource Hub
*In this project, we intend to provide a platform to accumulate many resources and information that we thought would have been better if they were available to us before we were preparing ourselves for a research career in physics. Neverthless, they have turned out to be highly useful for us. We are using this platform to provide a single stop to find the otherwise scattered online learning resources. This initiative is carried out by the Alumni and Faculties of the Department of Physics, Government College, Madappally, Vadakara.*
