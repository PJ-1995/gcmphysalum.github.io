# Text books

Deep and clear understanding about a subject cannot be gulped down from that-one-book-mentioned-in-the-university-syllabus alone. As a matter of fact, text book revisions are Herculean tasks at most of the universities and may take decades. It is important to read good text books with updated information. Also, the students need to deconstruct the idea of having a single-book-of-study. For a better understanding of a concept, you would want to read different books on that topic. This methodology gives you greater insight towards the subject as well as helps you to approach the text books more objectively.

We have listed a few text books - based on the undergraduate & postgraduate syllabus, as well as given supplementary text books which will help the more curious ones among you to read beyond and above the syllabus.
