# Online Resources

<p style="text-align:justify">
The following are some physics online courses that could be useful at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The video lectures would constitute only a small portion of a course. One should download tutorials, lecture notes, problem sets, and exam papers. Unfortunately, many universities in India do not cultivate this culture of seeking knowledge elsewhere.

These video lectures are so awesome that you can merely sit and listen to these lectures and grasp a great deal of things, but it will only be fruitful by doing related problems and exam papers as seriously as one would do in a course. Below, we have tried to organize them according to difficulty levels.
