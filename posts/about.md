## About the Physics Resource Hub
In this project, we intend to provide a platform to accumulate many resources and information that we thought would have been better if they were available to us before we were preparing ourselves for a research career in physics. Neverthless, they have turned out to be highly useful for us. We are using this platform to provide a single stop to find the otherwise scattered online learning resources. This initiative is carried out by the Alumni and Faculties of the Department of Physics, Government College, Madappally, Vadakara.
